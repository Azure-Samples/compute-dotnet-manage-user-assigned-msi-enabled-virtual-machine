# Getting started on managing a virtual machine with User Assigned MSI using C# #

          Azure Compute sample for managing virtual machines -
           - Create a Resource Group and User Assigned MSI with CONTRIBUTOR access to the resource group
           - Create a Linux VM and associate it with User Assigned MSI
               - Install Java8, Maven3 and GIT on the VM using Azure Custom Script Extension
           - Run Java application in the MSI enabled Linux VM which uses MSI credentials to manage Azure resource
           - Retrieve the Virtual machine created from the MSI enabled Linux VM.
